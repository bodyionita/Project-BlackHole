## About :information_source:

The project **BlackHole** is a holographic galaxy built around a black hole where all the stars represent 
specific public companies. The relationship between stars and the black hole, their shape 
and color is defined by stock price data such as volume, price and time.

The aim of this project is to transform raw data sets into an interactive and immersive experience by 
visualising everything in Virtual Reality through the use of an Android mobile phone and a VR headset like
[Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/)
